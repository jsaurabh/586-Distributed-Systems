# 586-Distributed-Systems
Course repo for CSE586 at UB CSE

Android based introduction to distributed systems. 586 is a fun and intense course that goes throught the fundamentals of distributed systems at a highly conceptual level and the projects are implemented on the Android platform.

The course projects take the form of a messenger app, built in an iterative fashion starting from basic message passing functionality to more robust, fault-tolerance, failure recovery and consistency guarantees expected of a highly distributed system
